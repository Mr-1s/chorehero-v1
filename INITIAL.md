## UI BRAINSTORMING:
When designing screens, always provide 3 different approaches:
1. Trust-focused version (emphasizing safety/verification)
2. Speed-focused version (minimal taps to booking)
3. Social-proof version (ratings/video testimonials prominent)

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- Trust is paramount - users letting strangers into homes
- Video verification reduces anxiety about cleaner identity
- BiteSight-inspired video discovery for service providers
- Focus on 30-45 minute "Express Clean" niche initially
- Target urban professionals needing quick, reliable cleaning
