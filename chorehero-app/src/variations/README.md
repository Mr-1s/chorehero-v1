# ChoreHero MVP Variations

Three distinct implementations of the ChoreHero cleaning marketplace app, each showcasing different design philosophies and user experience approaches while maintaining the core "Swipe-Watch-Book-Clean" concept.

## Running the Variations

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Installation
```bash
cd chorehero-app
npm install
```

### Running Individual Variations

To run a specific variation, update the main App.tsx import:

```typescript
// For Trust-First
import App from './src/variations/trust-first/App';

// For Speed-First  
import App from './src/variations/speed-first/App';

// For Social-Proof
import App from './src/variations/social-proof/App';

// For Variation Selector
import App from './src/variations/App';
```

Then run:
```bash
expo start
```

## Design Comparison

| Feature | Trust-First | Speed-First | Social-Proof |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Onboarding | 3 screens (detailed) | Skippable | 2 screens (community) |
| Booking Flow | 4 steps + verification | 2 steps (express) | 3 steps + social sharing |
| Video Emphasis | Moderate | Minimal | Heavy |
| Trust Indicators | Prominent | Minimal | Community-based |
| Social Features | None | None | Extensive |
| Speed Optimization | Low | High | Medium |

## Mock Data

All variations use shared mock data with 5 sample cleaners, including:
- Professional photos and video thumbnails
- Realistic pricing ($38-52/hour)
- Varied experience levels (3-8 years)
- Different specialties and availability
- Customer testimonials and ratings

## Future Enhancements

Each variation can be extended with:
- Real video integration
- Backend API connections
- Payment processing
- Real-time tracking
- Push notifications
- Advanced filtering
- User profiles and history

## Performance Considerations

- Images are optimized for mobile
- Videos use efficient thumbnails
- Gesture animations use native drivers
- Mock data simulates realistic API responses
- Components are designed for 60fps interactions

## Testing

Each variation includes:
- Gesture interaction testing
- Video playback testing
- Navigation flow testing
- UI component testing
- Mock data validation

This implementation demonstrates how the same core functionality can be presented through different UX lenses, each optimized for specific user priorities and use cases.
