# Category Filtering Test Guide

## âœ… Implementation Complete

### What Was Built:

1. **Database Schema Updates** (`category_services_migration.sql`)
   - Added `room_type` and `category` columns to services table
   - Created `service_categories` table with predefined categories
   - Inserted room-specific services (Kitchen, Bathroom, Living Room, Bedroom, Outdoors)
   - Updated cleaner specialties to match UI categories
   - Added proper indexes for performance

2. **CategoryService** (`src/services/category.ts`)
   - `getServicesByCategory(category)` - filters services by room type
   - `getCleanersBySpecialty(category)` - filters cleaners by matching specialties
   - `getRecommendedServices(userId, category)` - category-aware recommendations
   - Proper error handling and loading states

3. **Updated DiscoverScreen** (`src/screens/shared/DiscoverScreen.tsx`)
   - Connected category tabs to real database queries
   - Dynamic section titles based on selected category
   - Loading states for each section
   - Empty states when no results found
   - Parallel data loading for better performance

### Testing Steps:

#### 1. Database Migration Test
```bash
# Run the migration in your Supabase dashboard
cat chorehero-app/supabase/category_services_migration.sql
```

#### 2. Category Tab Functionality
- [ ] **Featured Tab**: Shows mix of popular services from all categories
- [ ] **Kitchen Tab**: Shows only kitchen-related services and cleaners
- [ ] **Bathroom Tab**: Shows only bathroom-related services and cleaners  
- [ ] **Living Room Tab**: Shows living room services and cleaners
- [ ] **Bedroom Tab**: Shows bedroom services and cleaners
- [ ] **Outdoors Tab**: Shows outdoor/garage services and cleaners

#### 3. Expected Behavior When Tab Is Pressed:
1. **Loading State**: Shows spinner with "Loading cleaners..." 
2. **Popular Services Section**: Updates to show category-specific services
3. **Trending Cleaners Section**: Filters to cleaners with matching specialties
4. **Recommended Section**: Shows category-aware recommendations
5. **Section Titles**: Updates to include category name (e.g., "Trending Kitchen Cleaners")

#### 4. Data Validation:
- [ ] Services show correct prices and durations from database
- [ ] Cleaners show real ratings and specialties
- [ ] Images load properly for each service type
- [ ] Empty states appear when no data exists for a category

#### 5. Performance Test:
- [ ] Category switches happen smoothly (< 1 second)
- [ ] No duplicate API calls when switching back to previous category
- [ ] Proper error handling when database is unreachable
