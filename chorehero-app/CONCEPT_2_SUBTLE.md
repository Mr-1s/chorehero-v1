## ✨ Features:
- **Color-shifting Cards**: Background hues change on hover/press
- **Breathing Animations**: Subtle scale pulse (1.0 → 1.02 → 1.0)
- **Micro-interactions**: Icons that wiggle, text that shifts
- **Gradient Borders**: Animated rainbow borders that flow
- **Parallax Elements**: Icons move slightly independent of cards
- **Shadow Dancing**: Shadows that shift color based on interaction

- **Response animations** to touch events
- **State changes** that feel organic
- **Color transitions** that follow brand palette
